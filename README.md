# Project 4: Electricity Bill Prediction

## Objectives 

* How do different household variables influence the electricity bill?
* Using machine learning to create a regression model that accurately predicts monthly electricity bill.
* Using the model to create an app that allows users to input variables and receive a predicted energy bill for the month.
